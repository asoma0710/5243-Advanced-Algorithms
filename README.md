## 🧠 Project Overview

This project explores **Delaunay Triangulation**, a fundamental geometric algorithm used in mesh generation, computer graphics, and numerical simulation. The goal was to understand, implement, and explain the triangulation process through various algorithmic approaches including:

- **Bowyer–Watson Incremental Insertion**
- **Divide & Conquer Strategy**
- **Sweep Line (Fortune's Algorithm)**
- **Edge Flip Optimization**

We also studied its **dual relationship with Voronoi diagrams** and its critical role in applications like FEM (Finite Element Methods), geospatial networks, and interpolation.
